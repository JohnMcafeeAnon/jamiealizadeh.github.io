        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p><small>Saturday, Nov. 4, 2023</small><br> The Canadian Populist</p>


      <p>
        Founded in 2019, The Canadian Populist (<a href="https://www.canadianpopulist.com/">https://www.canadianpopulist.com/</a>) is a Canadian news publication, dedicated to providing news stories which resonate with everyday Canadians. We believe that every citizen's voice holds significance, and our mission is to provide a platform that covers the issues that matter most to the Canadian public, tackling subjects often neglected or overlooked by the mainstream media.       </p>

      <p>
        Core to our mission is our focus on the growing disparity of political power that seems to continuously be funnelled towards a global elite. We closely follow and report on Canadian policies that favour the ruling class at the expense of Candian citizens – which are often characterized by favouritism, regulatory capture, and a deliberate lack of transparency.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The World Economic Forum (WEF) is one such organization comprised of global elites that our publication pays close attention to. Their influence on the Liberal Party of Canada cannot be understated, as the founder and CEO of the WEF has himself claimed that more than half of Trudeau’s cabinet has been penetrated by his organization, as you can see <a href="https://twitter.com/wideawake_media/status/1716436531961839904">here</a>. 
      </p>      
      
      <p>
        While many of our readers are politically conservative, The Canadian Populist is not partisan. We have oftentimes depicted Trudeau’s government as proponents for the WEF and globalist interests, while juxtaposing his governing style with Poilievre who we believe represents Canadian citizens. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We encourage our readers to be sceptical, to do their own research, and to arrive at their own conclusions about what is going on in Canadian politics. 
      </p>
