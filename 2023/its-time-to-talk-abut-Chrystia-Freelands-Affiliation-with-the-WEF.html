        <h2>It's time to talk about Chrystia Freeland's Affilation with the WEF</h2>
        <p><small>Tuesday, Sept. 17, 16:15h</small><br> By AP Agency</p>

        <div class="headline" style="background-image: url(../images/Freeland1.jpg)"></div>

        <p class="intro-text">Conspiracy theories aside, the World Economic Forum makes little effort to refute
           their reputation as an organisation that prioritises their elite "ingroup" over the needs of the
           everyday citizen.</p>
           
        <p>When you think global elite, you immediately think "politician that doesn't want
           to draw undue attention to themselves, spends minimal effort appealing directly to citizens, and
           passionately attends global networking conferences in the Swiss Alps". </p>

        <p>Pierre Poilievre has publicly stated that he will not allow any members of his cabinet have an affiliation with the WEF. Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau and Chrystia Freeland stand out as decorated, representative members of that class of politician.  </p>

        <p>The founder and CEO of the WEF has stated on record, in a speech delivered to Harvard business students, that he “penetrates cabinets” and that more than half of Trudeau 's cabinet are former “Young Global Leaders” that are affiliated with the WEF. </p>

        <p>This begs the question, are Canadians electing their leaders or are wealthy elites dictating who should be running Canada and consequently dictating the policies from on high, and passing them down to bureaucrats that quietly do their bidding? 
        </p>

        <p>This is a relevant question to ask because so many of Trudeau 's policies seem to squarely oppose the interests of Canadians and are overwhelmingly unpopular amongst voters in poll after poll. 

        </p>

        <p>If it were the case that Trudeau was running Canada for the sake of helping Canadians with the many troubles afflicting them at this time, then there would be some sort of willingness by him to call an election and allow Canadian voters to determine who was running the Country. But it's the obvious case that instead, Trudeau seems to dedicate every bit of his power to keeping his position as Prime Minister of Canada, despite the fact that he has been in that position for the past eight years and the country has gotten dramatically worse off under his watch. </p>

        <p>So, what exactly is the purpose of him running Canada? If he's not in it for Canadians, is it possible that he is running Canada to benefit people besides Canadians? The answer is an obvious yes. Of course, Trudeau is running the country for the benefit of global elites that, like him, enjoy flying around on private jets every year to meet in Davos Switzerland and network with the other wealthy businesspeople and politicians. </p>

        <p>His closest alliances with other politicians seem to be with politicians that are also affiliated with the World Economic Forum, such as Jacinda Ardern and Emmanuel Macron. They seem to have a collective vision for how they wish to impact the globe, and all of their policies tend to be very tyrannical and be somewhat unpopular amongst the citizens of those countries. 

        </p>

        <p>Even more concerning than Trudeau's affiliation with the WEF, which end of itself is concerning, is Chrystia Freeland's affiliation with that organisation. </p>

        <p>Freeland is a Board of Trustee’s Member of the World Economic Forum. by nature of the title, she is entrusted to look after the World Economic Forum's interests, or in other words global interests. And if you're willing to give the WEF the benefit of the doubt that they actually are looking to benefit citizens, rather than themselves, which is highly unlikely proposition, then it's still a preposterous conflict of interest as there are so many instances where these interests diverge. </p>

        <p>
            And in these instances, such as funding for Ukraine and carbon taxes, Canadians want their own interests to be looked after first and foremost. But the priority seems to first be looking after the elites' interest, secondly looking after the globe's interest, and thirdly looking after Canadians. 
        </p>

        <p>It's worth asking what exactly she does for the WEF, if not influence Canadian policy on their behalf. Considering that she already has the position of finance minister and deputy Prime Minister of Canada, there's very little reason to believe that she provides any substance of value to that organisation excluding crafting policies in the manner that benefits them. 
        </p>

        <p>It would be extremely naive to think that she guides their policies and helps govern the WEF. The more logical and obvious conclusion is that she guides Canadian policies in a manner that benefits the members of this global organisation. 
        </p>
 
        <p>
        It’s also quite concerning when you consider the context of Trudeau’s many, many scandals. The vast majority of Trudeau’s many scandals appear to have a common theme of putting his interests or interests of his wealthy friends ahead of his citizens. Be it by taking expensive vacations to expensive properties owned by these friends, or overpaying 20-fold the expected price you'd pay for an app like ArriveCAN, inevitably people close to Trudeau benefit and Canadian taxpayers suffer. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The secondary unifying theme of Trudeau 's scandals is the tyrannical nature of them. Putting aside his inviting at Nazi to speak at Canada's parliament, his decision to use the emergencies act to end the trucker convoy was a deliberate and coordinated effort to prevent Canadians from protesting against his (ironically tyrannical) Covid vaccination policies. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        She offers very little indication that she is tuned in to the needs that Canadians have. Rarely do Chrystia Freelander Justin Trudeau ever listened to Canadians or take questions from Canadians in a manner which would indicate that they’re attentive to the people that they represent. But on the flip side, they regularly attend international meetings for organisations like the IMF, UN, CFR, and WEF. 
        </p>
 
        <p>
        A casual glance at the replies to her Twitter posts shows the general animosity that the average Canadian has towards Chrystia. The overwhelming majority of replies indicate deep trouble and even animosity expressed by Canadians. Canadians regularly ask her about her affiliation with the WF and what her responsibilities are as a board member of that organisation. Additionally, they asked her and Trudeau about whether the comments made by Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, about penetrating Canada's cabinet, were accurate. 
        </p>

        <p>
        These questions remain unanswered. And to this day she has never provided any clarity or any reassurance to Canadians that she can act in a manner that puts Canadians’ needs first, rather than global organisations. It's painfully obvious that she is deliberately trying to avoid this being cast into the public discourse. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Canadians should seek clarification about her role as a Board of Trustee’s member of the World Economic Forum. journalists and reporters should make that their single focus and their number one goal, as this is a very concerning and obvious conflict of interest that has arisen - Especially when considering how low Trudeau 's approval rating is and how little recourse Canadians have to get him out of office before and the lecture is called in 2025. 
        </p>
