        <h2>Andrew Sheer: "ArriveCAN App Should Have Cost a Few Thousand Dollars, Not $54 Million"</h2>
        <p><small>October 28th, 2023</small><br> By AP Agency</p>

        <div class="headline" style="background-image: url(../images/AndrewSheer.jpg)"></div>

          <p class="intro-text"> In a <a href="https://youtu.be/QLmg7qosl4Q?si=rp5kILXpAu_iRSYK&t=82"> recent video </a> posted on X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube, Sheer passionately denounced Trudeau's ArriveCAN app project, claiming that the app should have cost a few thousand dollars and instead the cost ballooned into $54 million dollars. He further claimed that these were "sweetheart contracts given to liberal-friendly firms for no work done".</p>
       
          <p>Sheer has recently raised concerns about the exorbitant costs associated with the development of the ArriveCAN app. According to Sheer, the app, which was intended to facilitate the entry of travelers into Canada, should have been a modest investment, not a multi-million-dollar expenditure that raises questions about governmental favouritism and fiscal responsibility.</p>

           <p>Highlighting the critical need for prudent financial practices, Sheer's remarks shed light on the broader implications of unchecked government spending. As a proponent of freedom and conscientious governance, Sheer's concerns echo those of many Canadians who expect their elected representatives to uphold the highest standards of fiscal responsibility while safeguarding the nation's sovereignty and democratic principles.</p>
       
           <p>Sheer's call for a comprehensive review of the ArriveCAN app's development and associated costs resonates with his commitment to ensuring that taxpayer funds are allocated judiciously and with the utmost transparency. His assertion that the app should have been a project costing only a few thousand dollars underscores the importance of exercising prudence in government expenditures and reinforces the necessity of maintaining a conscientious approach to financial management at the highest levels of the Canadian government.</p>
       
           <p>As the debate surrounding the ArriveCAN app expenditure continues to unfold, Sheer's unwavering dedication to preserving democracy and advocating for responsible governance remains a guiding force for those who prioritize the values of national sovereignty, conscientiousness, and freedom. With his vocal stance on the issue, Sheer emphasizes the imperative for increased accountability and oversight in government spending, ensuring that Canadian taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are utilized efficiently and in the service of the nation's best interests.</p>
       
           <p>In an era marked by growing concerns over governmental transparency and the safeguarding of democratic values, Sheer's critique serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the foundational principles that define Canada's identity. Through his commitment to fiscal prudence and his advocacy for conscientious governance, Sheer continues to champion the preservation of national sovereignty, conscientiousness, freedom, and the enduring strength of Canadian democracy.</p>
